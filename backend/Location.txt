      "<p>Originally owned by the Borough of Scarborough, the mainland at the base of the bluffs was transferred to the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority in May 1960 as part of the Waterfront Plan for Metro. The park was developed in two stages by the Authority. The first phase that satisfied a need for public open space, was officially completed and opened in 1975 at a cost of $2.2 million. Phase two, developed for $6.0 million and completed in the early 1980's, provided public launching facilities for recreational boaters and sailors, as well as open space for private yacht clubs. A total of 2.6 million cubic metres of lakefill was used at Bluffer's Park.</p>"
